**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered this quarter is IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). As the main focus of our project, IPFS offers a decentralized approach to data storage that could potentially address several issues inherent in centralized storage systems. The benefits of decentralization include improved privacy, more efficient data handling, and elimination of single points of failure. By distributing data across multiple nodes, IPFS makes individual nodes less vulnerable to attacks, enhancing overall system security.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For the Quarter 2 Project, I would like to delve deeper into IPFS technology, specifically investigating the potential issues and benefits of replacing centralized storage with IPFS. This could involve analyzing performance metrics, security implications, and scalability aspects of IPFS compared to traditional storage solutions.

**What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change to the current Quarter 1 Project approach would be implementing a local library for malware detection in the dataset. This approach contrasts with using an external library, which may compromise data privacy by potentially storing information on third-party servers for safety checks. By keeping the malware detection process local, we can enhance data privacy and security.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

An interesting technique to explore would be the deployment of a new cryptocurrency to handle transaction fees within the IPFS network. This could provide a native economic layer for incentivizing storage providers and managing resource allocation within the decentralized system.
