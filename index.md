# Predict_Calories-Model
Made by Brighton Chan and Lincoln Ma


## Problem Identification
When we were given a random meal,we do not know how much calories that we were
comsuming. In our data frame, we were given (cols) which can used to predict
the calories for receipes in our data set so we can tell how much calories are
we comsuming if the food item dont have the calories label.
