What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

IPFS, as it is the main topic that I focus on in our project and able to having decentrializing storage could improve the current problems of centrailize storage such as privacy, data handling and single point failure as the data is separate appart, attacking single note become more invulnerable 

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
I would go deeper in IPFS technology and the potenial issue and benefits of replacing centralize storage.

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

Trying to have a local library to check for malware in the dataset, compare to using a external library which may violate data privacy as it may store on other server to check for the safety.

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

Try to deploy a new crypto currency for the fee
